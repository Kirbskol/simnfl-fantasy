# SimNFL Fantasy

This application has been created as part of my final project for Harvard's CS50x course. It is designed for members of the SimFBA community to complete a fantasy draft of SimNFL players and export their drafted rosters to share (and probably brag) with others. SimFBA is a simulation game created by a group of people that have been playing sim sports games together for almost a decade! With an entirely fictional universe of players, it is your chance to immerse yourself as a Head Coach, GM or even an owner. This Fantasy draft app allows users to have a bit of fun, and try and draft the best team possible, to earn bragging rights with others!
