# SimNFL Fantasy

This application has been created as part of my final project for Harvards' CS50x course. It is designed for members of the SimFBA community to complete a fantasy draft of SimNFL players and export their drafted rosters to share (and probably brag) with others.

# Installation

- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to project directory
- Install dependencies
- Start development server

# Exporting your Roster

- Click the "Export" button located in the top right corner of the Roster page
  - You have to complete the draft to be able to export.
- The image will include your drafted roster, as well as an averaged overall rating for the team.

# Tech Used

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- html2canvas

# Roadmap

All of these features listed are not set in stone, but may be implemented in the future.

- Add user registration/login.
- Add functionality to store drafted teams in a database so users can retrieve previous drafts.
- Add multi-player function, where more than one user can draft simulatenously.
- Add functionality with the actual sim, to run weekly fantasy depending on results and player stats.
